# TECH-MIME

#### Welcome to the Debugging Challenge repository! This project is designed to help you improve your debugging skills by working on various C++ programs, organized by years. Each folder contains multiple programs for different year students. Follow the instructions below to navigate, debug, and execute the programs successfully.

## Folder Structure
#### The repository is divided into folders based on your year. Each folder contains a set of C++/python programs that you need to debug and get the output. 

## Instructions for Debugging
#### After debugging the code, open the terminal in Codespaces.Use the following command to execute the Python script associated with your program:
```python script_name.py```
#### Replace ```script_name.py``` with the name of the Python script provided for testing or verification.
