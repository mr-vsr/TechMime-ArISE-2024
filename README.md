# TECH-MIME

#### Welcome to the Debugging Challenge repository! This project is designed to help you improve your debugging skills by working on various C++ programs, organized by years. Each folder contains multiple programs for different year students. Follow the instructions below to navigate, debug, and execute the programs successfully.

## Folder Structure
#### The repository is divided into folders based on your year. Each folder contains a set of C++/python programs that you need to debug and get the output. 

## About the Event
#### Tech Mime is a two-phase team-based event that requires technical acumen and creative teamwork. Each team consists of four members, and the event proceeds as follows:

### Phase 1: Debugging
#### Three team members will debug a series of 12 C++ programs.The programs must be debugged and executed in order. After successfully debugging and executing a program, the output must be verified by the tech team.

### Phase 2: Mime and Guess
#### The fourth team member, who has not participated in debugging, will try to guess the programâ€™s output. The guessing process will involve: 
### The debugging members conveying the output using gestures only (no verbal communication or writing allowed).
#### The guesser writing the output on a piece of paper.
#### The output written by the guesser must be verified by the core team. If correct, the team can proceed to the next program.
#### The guesser changes after every three questions.

## Event Rules

### Team Composition

#### Each team must have four members.
#### Three members will debug the programs, and one member will guess the outputs.

### Debugging Rules

#### The programs are written in C++/python and must be debugged on Codespaces.
#### The programs must be debugged and executed in order (e.g., Program 1 before Program 2).
#### Outputs must be verified by the tech team after execution.

### Mime Rules

#### Team members are allowed to use gestures only to communicate the output.
#### No verbal hints, writing, or drawing is permitted.
#### Any violation of this rule will result in disqualification from the question.

### Guessing Rules

#### The guesser must write the output on a piece of paper.
#### The output must be verified by the core team before proceeding to the next question.
#### After every three questions, the guesser must rotate.

## Instructions for Debugging

#### After debugging the code, open the terminal in Codespaces.Use the following command to execute the Python script associated with your program:
```python script_name.py```
#### Replace ```script_name.py``` with the name of the Python script provided for testing or verification.
